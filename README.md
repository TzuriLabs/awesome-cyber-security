## Introduction

### What is Pentesting?

A penetration test, colloquially known as a pentest, is an authorized simulated cyberattack on a computer system, performed to evaluate the security of the system. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_test))

### What is Web App (Application) Pentesting?

A web application penetration test is a type of ethical hacking engagement designed to assess the architecture, design and configuration of web applications. Assessments are conducted to identify cyber security risks that could lead to unauthorised access and/or data exposure.

### What is Network Pentesting?

Network penetration testing is an attempt by an ethical hacker to breach an organization’s network without doing harm.
